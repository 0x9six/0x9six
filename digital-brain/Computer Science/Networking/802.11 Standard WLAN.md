# 802.11 WLAN Standard

In 1997 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers created the first WLAN standard. They called it _802.11_ after the name of the group formed to oversee its development. Unfortunately, 802.11 only supported a maximum [[Network Bandwidth]] of 2 Mbps—too slow for most applications. For this reason, ordinary 802.11 wireless products are no longer manufactured. However, an entire family has sprung up from this initial standard.
