# Lossy Compression

Lossy Compression (also known as irreversible compression) is a type of [[Compression Of Digital Files]] that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. 

TL;DR - it removes data and makes guesses in order to lower file sizes which can cause the compressed files to have a lower quality to the original uncompressed file.
