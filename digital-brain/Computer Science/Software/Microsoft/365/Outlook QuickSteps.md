# Microsoft Outlook QuickSteps

Quick Steps apply multiple actions at the same time to email messages. This helps you quickly manage your mailbox. For example, if you frequently move messages to a specific folder, you can use a Quick Step to move the message in one click. Or, if you want to pin an email and mark it as unread, a Quick Step can simplify the task inÂ one click.
