# Lossless Compression

Lossless Compression is a type of [[Compression Of Digital Files]] that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data with no loss of information. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. 

TL;DR - a super smart algorithm rewrites the file to make it more efficient by replacing non-essential information. Like a cleaner just for your files.
