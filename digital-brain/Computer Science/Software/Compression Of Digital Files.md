# Compression Of Digital Files

Compression means taking the original file and turning it into a new file that uses less bits without significant degradation of the files original quality. This is used to save on memory so we can have more files and reduce time it would take to transfer the file. 

the ratio between the original size and the compressed size is know as the [[Compression Ratio]]. 

There is two main types of compression, [[Lossy Compression]] and [[Lossless Compression]].
