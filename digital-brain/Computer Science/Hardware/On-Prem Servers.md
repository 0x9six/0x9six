# OnPrem / On-Premises

On-premises refers to the **use of the company’s own servers** and **IT environment** – on site. With this usage model, a customer often buys or rents server-based software as a licensee, which is installed on their own servers or rented servers. Since the licensee runs the software in their own data centre on their own or rented hardware, this is also called “**inhouse**”.
