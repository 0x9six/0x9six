# Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence is data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actorâ€™s motives, targets, and attack behaviors. Threat intelligence enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change their behavior from reactive to proactive in the fight against threat actors.
