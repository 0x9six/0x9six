# public-key cryptosystem

## TL;DR

*public key* = open to everyone and encrypts the message but can't decrypt it.
*private key* = a secret that can decrypt the message.

Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography is the field of cryptography that uses related keys. Each key pair has a public key and a private key. the keys are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key a secret. In a public-key encryption system, anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext, but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message
