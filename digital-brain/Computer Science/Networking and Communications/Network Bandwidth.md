# Network Bandwidth

The term bandwidth has a number of technical meanings but since the popularization of the internet, it has generally referred to the volume of information per unit of time that a transmission medium (like an internet connection) can handle.

An internet connection with a larger bandwidth can move a set amount of data (say, a video file) much faster than an internet connection with a lower bandwidth.

Bandwidth is typically expressed in bits per second, like 60 Mbps or 60 Mb/s, to explain a data transfer rate of 60 million bits (megabits) every second.
