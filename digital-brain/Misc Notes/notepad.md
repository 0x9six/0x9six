## Request to change departments

It is with regret that I must inform you that I believe I am unable to continue my position in the Cyber Security department. 

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have worked with you and the team, despite my limited experience, and I have gained valuable insights during my time there. However, I am currently facing personal and professional issues with one of my colleagues in the department, which are hindering my ability to execute my responsibilities to the best of my ability. Therefore, I believe it would be in the best interest of the department if I seek another opportunities.

This was an issue I intended to raise at our monthly 1 to 1 meeting which I decided against as I was conscious about the possibility of coming across unprofessional, but now I realise that was a mistake. I would like to express my interest in continuing to work at Technical Drive, and I would be grateful if you could consider me for a position in another department. I am confident that with my technical skill set, eagerness to learn and dedication, I can add value to any team within the company. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

Sincerely, 

----------------------------------

I am finding that my current position in Cyber Security is not challenging me as much as I require at this level in my career and would like to ask if I can spend time in Help Desk or move to Help Desk full time to improve my technical knowledge and confidence with clients.

Secondly, I am currently facing personal and professional issues with one of my colleagues in the department, which are hindering my ability to execute my responsibilities to the best of my ability. I have tried to overcome these issues but recently has become apparent that it would be in the best interest of the department if I seek another opportunities.

I intended to raise these issues at our monthly 1 to 1 meeting which I decided against as I was conscious about the possibility of coming across unprofessional, but now I realise that was a mistake. I would like to express my interest in continuing to work at Technical Drive, and I would be grateful if you could consider me for a position in another department. I am confident that with my technical skill set, eagerness to learn and dedication, I can add value to any team within the company

Thank you for your understanding.

**Newest Draft**

I have some concerns regarding my current position in Cyber Security I initially intended to raise at our monthly 1-to-1 meeting. However, I changed my mind as I was worried about appearing unprofessional. In hindsight, I realize that it was a mistake. 

While I am grateful for the opportunity to work in this role, I feel that I am not being challenged to the extent that I would like at this stage of my career. I would like to request the opportunity to spend some time in the Help Desk, or potentially move to the Help Desk full-time. I believe that doing so would help me improve my technical knowledge and build more confidence in my interactions with clients.

In addition, I have been experiencing some personal and professional challenges with one of my colleagues in the department. While I have tried to resolve these issues, I have realized that it may be best for the department if I explore other opportunities. I want to assure you that I remain committed to the success of the team and express my interest in continuing to work at Technical Drive.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
