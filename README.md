I am a Cyber Security student based in Europe. When I am not working at my full-time job or doing university coursework, I enjoy studying topics such as Mobile Security, Digital Forensics, Malware, and Low-Level programming. Currently, I am developing a tool that can map out a computer's file system and storage usage. In the future, I hope to expand this tool to have more practical use cases beyond my personal development. Additionally, I am planning to create a personal website soon.
